# Emotion Detection with Music Recommendation

## Overview
Emotion Detection with Music Recommendation is a deep learning-based application designed to support emotional well-being. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze emotions from facial expressions in real-time and recommends mood-aligned music to enhance the user experience.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Processes facial expressions in real-time to detect emotions accurately.
- **Personalized Music Recommendations**: Suggests music based on detected emotions to support mood enhancement.
- **Adaptability for Personalization**: Allows users to train the model with their own data for more customized recommendations.

## How It Works
### Emotion Detection Algorithm
The CNN-based emotion detector processes images to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and anxiety. Each detected emotion triggers a tailored music recommendation, fostering a supportive and therapeutic experience for the user.

### Music Selection Engine
After detecting an emotion, the system selects music that aligns with the identified mood, aiming to improve emotional well-being through music therapy.

## User Interaction
- **Emotion Detection**: Users can upload or capture an image to detect emotions in real-time.
- **Music Recommendation**: Following emotion detection, the app recommends music suited to the current mood.
- **Customization Options**: Users can adjust settings like sensitivity to emotions or preferred music genres.

## Customization
Advanced users can modify the emotion-detection sensitivity or retrain the model with custom data, allowing for unique and personalized recommendations that align with individual emotional responses.
